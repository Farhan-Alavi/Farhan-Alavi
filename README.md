- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Farhan-Alavi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a former QA Engineer turned Data Scientist. I've spent my entire QA career looking at data from the unstructured side - API, JSON files, Cypress code, and E2E website testing and now I'm looking forward to learning about the structured side!
- I'll add my DS capstone here and some Cypress side projects too. Stay tuned!
- Data is beautiful and seeing it from both sides of the coin is something I'm looking forward to doing!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the Data Science Bootcamp @BrainStation.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out by email if you need anything: Farhan.alavi1@gmail.com.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a pastry chef by hobby. I love baking complicated and intricate things like entremets and desserts with multiple layers/elements.
